# The SEOSAW Training School
## Studying how African savannas and woodlands are changing

### 19 January - 25 January 2020, Sokoine University of Agriculture, Morogoro, Tanzania

### Application deadline: 5 Nov 2019. Apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KP5zip8e6zMjS5uDLbNECwgrw9cgV46rDQNDi0D7i78/edit).

We announce a week-long training workshop, aimed at developing participant skills  in 1) collecting data appropriate for monitoring savannas and woodlands, 2) analysing data, and 3) preparing work for scientific publication.

The course will focus on how we evaluate the structure and change of savanna ecosystems, including tree, grass, and soil components, combining practical and theoretical perspectives. We will mix field practicals with data analysis using **R**, **QGIS** and the **Open Data Kit** for digital data collection. We will also focus on writing and presentation skills.

The course is aimed at students and practitioners interested in carbon cycling, diversity and ecology of African savannas and woodlands. The course is designed to be suitable for both academic and non-academic researchers, including government staff and NGO/project staff. The 7-day course will cover:

* The role of long-term observations in global change ecology
* Field methods for evaluating tree and grass diversity, ecosystem structure, and carbon stocks
* Data analysis using **R** and spatial data analysis using **QGIS** and **R**
* Data management and long term storage, including using tablets for data entry
* Written and oral communication of scientific results

The course will be taught by academics from Sokoine University of Agriculture and the Universities of Edinburgh and Yale, including Josiah Katani, Wilson Mugasha, [Carla Staver](https://staverlab.yale.edu/) and [Casey Ryan](https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/cryan/). More will be confirmed shortly.

A preliminary schedule is available [here](./summer_school_schedule.md).

## Applications for attendance and funding
Applications can be made via the [google form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KP5zip8e6zMjS5uDLbNECwgrw9cgV46rDQNDi0D7i78/edit). Participants will be selected based on the following criteria:

1. The fit between their current or intended research and the scientific content of the course
1. Interest in collaborative, regional-scale work, including possible participation in SEOSAW 
1. Academic track record of the applicant.

Funding is available to support travel for 15 scientists. Slots are also available for an additional 5 local scientists and up to 5 self-funded applicants. We will prioritise funding for scientists from low and middle income countries (see list [here](http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/DAC_List_ODA_Recipients2018to2020_flows_En.pdf)). Self-funded scientists will be selected purely on the criteria above. They will need to cover their transport to Morogoro or Dar Es Salaam (flights, visas, etc.) and accommodation during the workshop, but for simplicity we will cover meals at the site.

Timeline:
Application deadline: 5 Nov 2019
Decision notification: 12 Nov 2019

## Other notes
* The course will be taught in English
* This course is made possible by generous support from UK NERC and Yale University
* The course is an activity of the SEOSAW partnership, which is an activity of the Miombo Network. However the course content is relevant to anyone working in all savannas and woodlands in Africa, not just the miombo.
