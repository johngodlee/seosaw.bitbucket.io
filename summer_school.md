# The SEOSAW training school
## Training in long term field observations to understand how African savannas and woodlands are changing

### 28 July - 4 August 2019, Sokoine University of Agriculture, Morogoro, Tanzania

### Application deadline: 1 May 2019. Apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KP5zip8e6zMjS5uDLbNECwgrw9cgV46rDQNDi0D7i78/edit).

We announce a week-long training event, aimed at helping participants develop their skills 1) in collecting long term observations of savanna and woodlands, 2) analysing data, and 3) preparing work for scientific publication.

This course will focus on techniques for long term measurements of trees, grasses, and soil, and provide both practical and theoretical training. We will mix field practicals with data analysis using **R**, **QGIS** and the **Open Data Kit** for digital data collection. We will also focus on writing and presentation skills.

The course is aimed at students and practitioners interested in carbon cycling, diversity and ecology of African savannas and woodlands, with an emphasis on field approaches to long-term monitoring. The 7 day course covers:

* The role of long term observations in global change ecology
* Field methods: tree and grass diversity, ecosystem structure, carbon stocks
* Tree inventories
* Grass and forb inventories
* Soil sampling and analysis
* Sampling design
* Data analysis using **R**, and the SEOSAW analysis package `silvR`
* Spatial data analysis using **QGIS** and **R**
* Data management and long term storage, including using tablets for data entry
* Written and oral communication of scientific results

The course is designed to be suitable for both academic and non academic researchers, including government staff and NGO/project staff.

It will be taught by academics from Sokoine University of Agriculture and the Universities of Edinburgh and Yale, including Josiah Katani, Wilson Mugasha, [Carla Staver](https://staverlab.yale.edu/) and [Casey Ryan](https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/cryan/). More will be confirmed shortly.

A preliminary schedule is available [here](./summer_school_schedule.md).

## Applications for attendance and funding
Applications can be made via the [google form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KP5zip8e6zMjS5uDLbNECwgrw9cgV46rDQNDi0D7i78/edit). Participants will be selected based on the following criteria:

1. The fit between their current or intended research and the scientific content of the course
1. Interest in collaborative, regional-scale work, including possible participation in SEOSAW 
1. Academic track record of the applicant.

Funding is available for 15 scientists and the course will be for a maximum of 25 people, so we will accept up to 10 self-funded applicants.  We will prioritise funding for scientists from low and middle income countries (see list [here](http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/DAC_List_ODA_Recipients2018to2020_flows_En.pdf)). Self funded scientists will be selected purely on the criteria above. They will need to cover their transport to Morogoro or Dar (flights, visas etc) but we will cover accommodation and meals at the site.

Timeline:
Application deadline: 1 May 2019.
Decision notification: 15 May 2019.

## Other notes
* The course will be taught in English
* This course is made possible by generous support from UK NERC and Yale University
* The course is an activity of the SEOSAW partnership, which is an activity of the Miombo Network. However the course content is relevant to anyone working in all savannas and woodlands in Africa, not just the miombo.
