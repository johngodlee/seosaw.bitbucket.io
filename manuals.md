# Manuals

We are developing a set of linked protocols that will allow for data collected accross the region to be compared, whilst retaining flexibility to suit the many different objectives of researchers in the region.

The following protocols are in the works, after we agreed at the first meeting to prioritse these:

1.	[Plot design, coordinated by Casey Ryan (currently out for consultation)][1]
2.	[Tree stem measurements, Casey Ryan (currently out for consultation)] [1]
3.	Understory plants, Caroline Lehmann (in prep)
4.	[Soil, Mathew Williams (in prep)][3]
5.	Traits:
	a.	Trees, Carla Staver (currently out for consultation)
	b.	Grasses 
	c.	[Seedlings, Ricardo Holdo (currently out for consultation)][2]

They are all living documents, and we welcome input and suggestions from all. Please use Google Docs to comment on the protocols, following the links above.

The intention is to refine them througout 2018 and then publish them.
