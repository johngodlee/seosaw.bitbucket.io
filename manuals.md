# Measurement protocols for African woodlands and savannas

We are developing a set of linked protocols that will allow for data collected across the region to be compared, whilst retaining flexibility to suit the many different objectives of researchers in the region.

The following protocols are in the works, after we agreed at the first meeting to prioritise the following:

* [Plot design and tree measurements, including deadwood and saplings.][1] 
* [Understory plants, Caroline Lehmann.][2]
* [Trees traits, Carla Staver][3]
* Soil, Mathew Williams and Iain McNicol. - Draft in progress.
* Seedling traits, Ricardo Holdo. - Draft in progress.

All the protocols are 'living documents', and we welcome input and suggestions from all.

We provide template field datasheets and a data contribution manual, if you are thinking about setting up your own plot in the SEOSAW style:

* [Plot info sheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/blank_plot.pdf)
* [Stem measurement sheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/blank_stem.pdf)
* [Data contribution manual]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/seosaw_contrib_guide.pdf)

An ODK Android tablet data entry form is also being developed.

## Purpose of the protocols

* Not to suggest novel methods, but to borrow from elsewhere, and present methods that have been tried and tested by the partners in tropical savannas and woodlands.
* To share experience about what works and what does not, to avoid mistakes being repeated.
* To allow data to be collected in a way that makes it easy to integrate with others in the SEOSAW network, and gives confidence is comparisons across the network.
* To make the SEOSAW network as comparable as possible with other regional networks in the wet tropics such as [AfriTRON](http://www.afritron.org), and with other savanna and dry forest plot networks.
* To provide guidance on the minimum set of measurements to achieve integration within SEOSAW, but not to preclude many other measurements. 
* The methods are also designed to be compatible with the data in [ForestPlots.net](https://www.forestplots.net) (although they are not as exhaustive) to allow the use of the FP.net data infrastructure and associated analysis tools.
* To minimise effort by reducing the need to document methods (if they are in line with the protocol). E.g. you should be able to say "we followed the SEOSAW protocol version x").
* To minimise effort by allowing the use of the SEOSAW data tables, code, database, and tablets for data collection, and the use of [ForestPlots.net](https://www.forestplots.net) for long term, secure storage.
* To suggest methods aimed at long term permanent plots that are to be remeasured approximately every 2-5 years to study changes in ecosystem structure, diversity, carbon storage, mortality and growth. 
* To provide a flexible approach suited for the many-small-plots paradigm and also the few-large-plots approach which has come to dominate research in the wet tropics.

## SEOSAW dataset 

The SEOSAW dataset is available for research purposes following agreement from all data contributors. Please contact us if you woul like to use or contribute to the SEOSAW dataset. 

SEOSAW maintains a strict data sharing agreement and code of conduct for SEOSAW members who wish to use SEOSAW data or contribute to the SEOSAW database. Please see the full [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/SEOSAW_CoC_V2.1_200504.pdf) and the accompanying [plain language summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/seosaw_coc_plain_summary_v2.1_200504.txt). 

The dataset uses two tables to organise data, a __stems__ table and a __plots__ table. To help guide your own data collection, refer to these pages which document the format of the data stored in each of these tables:

* [Stem table columns]({{ site.baseurl }}/stem_columns)
* [Plot table columns]({{ site.baseurl }}/plot_columns)

Additionally, refer to the [seosawR package vignette]({{ site.baseurl }}/vignette) for more information on how the SEOSAW dataset is cleaned and how you can format your own data in a SEOSAW friendly way. [See here for further description of the SEOSAW dataset]({{ site.baseurl }}/description).
