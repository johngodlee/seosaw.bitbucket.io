## Measurement protocols suitable for African woodlands and savannas
We are developing a set of linked protocols that will allow for data collected accross the region to be compared, whilst retaining flexibility to suit the many different objectives of researchers in the region.

The following protocols are in the works, after we agreed at the first meeting to prioritse these:

1.	[Plot design, coordinated by Casey Ryan (currently out for consultation)][1]
2.	[Tree stem measurements, Casey Ryan (currently out for consultation)] [1]. Includes deadwood and saplings.
3.	Understory plants, Caroline Lehmann (in prep)
4.	[Soil, Mathew Williams (in prep)][3]
5.	Traits:
	a.	[Trees, Carla Staver (currently out for consultation)][4]
	b.	Grasses, to be developed
	c.	[Seedlings, Ricardo Holdo (currently out for consultation)][2]

They are all living documents, and we welcome input and suggestions from all. Please use Google Docs to comment on the protocols, following the links above.

The intention is to refine them througout 2018 and then publish them.

## Purpose of the protocols
* Not to suggest novel methods, but to borrow from elsewhere, and present methods that have been tried and tested by the partners in tropical savannas and woodlands
* To share experience about what works and what does not, to avoid mistakes being repeated
* To allow data to be collected in a way that makes it easy to integrate with others in the SEOSAW network, and gives confidence is comparisons across the network
* To make the SEOSAW network as comparable as possible with other regional networks in the wet tropics such as AfriTRON, and with other savanna and dry forest plot networks
* To provide guidance on the minimum set of measurements to achieve integration within SEOSAW, but not to preclude many other measurements. 
* The methods are also designed to be compatible with the data in ForestPlots.net (although they are not as exhaustive) to allow the use of the FP.net data infrastructure and associated analysis tools.
* To minimise effort by reducing the need to document methods (if they are in line with the protocol). E.g. you should be able to say "we followed the SEOSAW protocol version x")
* To minimise effort by allowing the use of the SEOSAW data tables, code, database, and tablets for data collection, and the use of ForestPlots.net for long term, secure storage.
* The plot design described here is geared towards long term permanent plots that are to be remeasured approximately every 2-5 years to study changes in ecosystem structure, diversity, carbon storage, mortality and growth. Some of the suggestions will also be useful for one-off plots.
* To provide a flexible approach suited for the many-small-plots paradigm and also the few-large-plots approach which has come to dominate research in the wet tropics.
