We are developing a set of linked protocols that will allow for data collected accross the region to be compared, whilst retaining flexibility to suit the many different objectives of researchers in the region.

The following protocols are in the works:

1.	Plot design
2.	Tree stem measurements
3.	Understory plants
4.	Soil
5.	Traits:
a.	trees 
b.	grasses
c.	seedlings
