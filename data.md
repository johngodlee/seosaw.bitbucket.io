## The SEOSAW network

The SEOSAW partnership holds plot data from accross the region. As major activity of SEOSAW is collating these data and conducting regional analyses of the structure and function of the woodlands and savannas.

The map below shows the location of the main data sets the partnership holds. This map is still being updated as we add new data sets.

## Data

Once the synthesis is done, the data will be stored in [ForestPlots.net][1] for those members of the partnership who wish to make their data, or just their meta data, public. As part of the SEOSAW project, [ForestPlots.net][1] is being adapted to allow it to handle data from savannas and woodlands more easily. This part of SEOSAW is being led by Prof. Simon Lewis at Leeds / UCL.

If you are interested in being involved in data synthesis activities and have data you would like to contribute, please contact [Casey Ryan][2]
