# Data

We are in the process of collating data from accross the region for a set of regional synthesis papers. Once these are done, the data will be stored in [ForestPlots.net][1] for those members of the partnership who wishto make their data, or just meta data, public. As part of the SEOSAW project, [ForestPlots.net][1] is being adapted to allow it to 
handle data from savannas and woodlands more easily. This part of SEOSAW is being led by Prof. Simon Lewis at Leeds / UCL.

If you are interested in being involved in data synthesis activities and have data you would like to contribute, please contact [Casey Ryan][2]
