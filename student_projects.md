# Using the SEOSAW dataset in your own research 

The SEOSAW dataset and plot network is a valuable resource for research, especially for students and early career researchers looking to work with established large datasets. 

If you would like to use the existing data in your own research project, or contribute new data to the plot network, please contact us through our [contact form]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html). 

<!--
If you are a student, we also have a repository of potential student project ideas which use the SEOSAW data. [You can find the link here](GOOGLE_DRIVE_LINK).
